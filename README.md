# Parquet

This class library implements core game mechanics and data models for a crafting- and building-focused sandbox game with support for integrated narrative.

The goal of this project is twofold:
1) To provide a foundation for games developed in Unity, MonoGame, and other C# stacks;
2) To provide a learning exercise and portfolio piece for the lead developer.

Design and usage will be fully documented in [the wiki](https://github.com/mxashlynn/ParquetClassLibrary/wiki) once the [Alpha milestone](https://github.com/mxashlynn/ParquetClassLibrary/milestone/2) has been reached.


# Version 0.1.0 Warning

Code and documentation are incomplete and under rapid development.  Expect frequent breaking changes.  Maybe don't use this yet; when the [Alpha milestone](https://github.com/mxashlynn/ParquetClassLibrary/milestone/2) is hit the project should be much more usable.
