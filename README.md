# ParquetClassLibrary
This class library implements the core game mechanics for Parquet,
a personal game being developed in Unity.  I am implementing the
mechanics separately as a learning exercise.

Please see [the wiki](https://github.com/mxashlynn/ParquetClassLibrary/wiki) for more information.

# Version 0.1.0 Warning

Code and documentation are incomplete and under rapid development.  Expect frequent breaking changes.  Maybe don't use this yet; when the [Alpha Vertical Slice milestone](https://github.com/mxashlynn/ParquetClassLibrary/milestone/2) is hit the project should be much more usable.
