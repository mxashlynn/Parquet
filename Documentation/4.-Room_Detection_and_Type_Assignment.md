## Motivation

One of the primary features of the game is to allow the player to build and alter structures of various kinds.

To represent these structures in terms of the game's mechanics, and to work with them in code, they are modeled as specific rooms.  Rooms may have particular types, suited to particular uses.

Of course, the player may have any number of intended purposes for a given construction.

But from the perspective of the game's rules, it is necessary to keep a running list of all rooms in the play space at any given time that those rules recognize.

This list must be continually updated as the player plays.

The following algorithm and accompanying set of definitions solves this problem.

As the construction and updating of this list is likely to be one of the most expensive tasks that the software carries out on a regular basis, the algorithm is intended to be as efficient as possible while still being fairly easy to comprehend.

## Definitions

The algorithm primarily considers ParquetStacks.

A **ParquetStack** is a collection of parquets containing at most one of each type of parquet:
1. a Floor;
2. a Block;
3. a Furnishing;
4. a Collectible.

The algorithm distinguishes between several classes of parquets.

An **Enclosing Furnishing** is a Furnishing marked as Enclosing at design time. (E.g., doors are Enclosing.)

An **Entry Furnishing** is a Furnishing marked as an Entry at design time. (E.g., stairs and doors are Entry.)

A **Liquid Block** is a Block marked as Liquid at design time. (E.g., water blocks are Liquid.)

***

The algorithm operates over Regions and Subregions.

**Regions** are collections of ParquetStacks arranged in a rectilinear grid.  We can think of each Region as a graph where each node is a particular ParquetStack.

**Subregions** are any connected subset of ParquetStacks contained in a Region.  Thus, they are a sub-graph.

**4-connected** means that any given node in these graphs may be connected to (have edges to) at most 4 other nodes, and that the connections exist in two orthogonal dimensions.

<img src="https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet/blob/master/Documentation/Algorithms/4-Connected.png" alt="A node and its 4-connected neighbors." width="164">

**Coordinates** of graph nodes are given in (x, y).

A **Space** is a ParquetStack together with its Coordinates on the grid.  From now on, graph nodes will be referred to as Spaces.

A **Walkable Space** is a Space such that:
1) It has a Floor; _and_
2) It does not have a Block; _and_
3) it does not have an Enclosing Furnishing.

An **Enclosing Space** is a Space such that:
1) It has a non-Liquid Block; _or_
2) It has an Enclosing Furnishing.

An **Obstructed Space** is any space that is neither a Walkable Space nor an Enclosing Space.
These include Spaces without floors and Spaces with Liquid Blocks.

An **Entry Space** is a Walkable Space or an Enclosing Space that contains an Entry Furnishing.

A **Potential Walkable Area** is a collection of 4-connected Walkable Spaces.

A **Valid Walkable Area** is a Potential Walkable Area such that:
1) there are at least the minimum number of Walkable Spaces; _and_
2) there are no more than the maximum number of Walkable Spaces; _and_
3) given an arbitrary Walkable Space within the PWA it is possible to reach every other Walkable Space in the PWA using only 4-connected movements to only other Walkable Spaces.  (That is, without ever "stepping on" a non-Walkable Space.)

A **Potential Perimeter** is a collection of 4-connected Enclosing Spaces.

A **Valid Perimeter** is a Potential Perimeter such that:
1) given an arbitrary Enclosing Space within the PP it is possible to reach every other Enclosing Space in the PP using only 4-connected movements to only other Enclosing Spaces.  (That is, without ever "stepping on" a non-Enclosing Space.)

_Note_ that both Valid Walkable Areas and Valid Perimeters have the following property:
From any given Space, it is possible to reach every other Space in the collection through 4-connected movements.

_Note_ further that this means Perimeters may contain spurs intruding into the enclosed Walkable spaces or extruding outward into the surrounding area.

_Note_ also that Perimeters and Walkable Areas may surround Obstructing Spaces but may not contain them.

A **Potential Room** is:
1) a Valid Walkable Area;
2) a Valid Perimeter;

A **Valid Room** is a Potential Room such that:
1) every space in its Valid Walkable Area is surrounded by it's Valid Perimeter; _and_
2) Together, its Valid Walkable Area and its Valid Perimeter contain at least one Entry Space.

Valid Rooms also track their location via the Coordinates of their upper-leftmost Space.

Valid Rooms also track their assigned Type.

A Space is said to be **Just Outside** a Potential Walkable Area iff:
1) it is not in the PWA; _and_
2) its Coordinates differ from those of a Space in the PWA by exactly +/- 1 in either X or Y but not both.

## Algorithm

### Once a Region Finishes Loading

1. Find all Potential Walkable Areas
    1. Scan an entire Region row-by-row by examining each Space in a given row.
    2. At each Space _s_ for which _s_ is a Walkable Space, examines the two neighbors of _s_ which have already been encountered. (These are the Space to the left of _s_ and the Space above _s_ .)
        <img src="https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet/blob/master/Documentation/Algorithms/Scanning.png" alt="s and its previously encountered neighbors." width="200">
        * If both neighbors are non-Walkable Spaces, create a new list of Walkable Spaces and add _s_;
        * If only one neighbor is a Walkable Space, add _s_ to the list of spaces that contains that neighbor;
            * If adding _s_ to the list of spaces would bring the space count above a Room's maximum allowable Space count, mark the list as invalid.
        * If both neighbors are Walkable Spaces, merge their lists and add _s_ to it.
            * If adding _s_ to the list of spaces would bring the space count above a Room's maximum allowable Space count, mark the list as invalid.
    3. _Optimization_.  Discard any lists of Walkable Spaces that are marked invalid.
    4. _Optimization_.  Discard any lists of Walkable Spaces containing fewer than a Room's minimum allowable Space count.
    5. We now have all the Potential Walkable Areas.
2. Validate Walkable Areas
    1. For each Potential Walkable Area, begin at an arbitrary Space within the PWA and perform a 4-connected Depth-First Search with Iterative Deepening, where the search's maximum depth is set to the number of Spaces in the PWA.
    2. If the search does not return the same number of Spaces as the PWA, discard this PWA.
    3. We now have all Valid Walkable Areas.
3. Find Seeds for the Potential Perimeters
    1. For each Valid Walkable Area:
        1. Find the four Extrema of the VWA.  That is, find those Spaces in the VWA such that:
            * Their x Coordinate is the greatest of all x Coordinates in the VWA;
            * Their x Coordinate is the least of all x Coordinates in the VWA;
            * Their y Coordinate is the greatest of all y Coordinates in the VWA;
            * Their y Coordinate is the least of all y Coordinates in the VWA;
            <img src="https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet/blob/master/Documentation/Algorithms/Extrema.png" alt="A walkable area and its extrema." width="200"><br />
            If more than one Space corresponds to one of these categories, they are equivalent so choose one arbitrarily.
        2. Find the Space that is Just Outside each Extreme in the direction of that Extreme's extreme Coordinate.
            <br /><img src="https://github.com/mxashlynn/Parquet/blob/master/Documentation/Algorithms/Just-Outside.png" alt="A walkable area and the Spaces just outside its extrema." width="274"><br />
            * If this Space is an Enclosing Space, add it to a list of potential perimeter Seeds.
            * Otherwise, the space must be an Obstructing Space.  In this case:
                1. Find the next Space in the direction of the extreme Coordinate and increment a Step Counter.
                    * If the next Space is an Enclosing Space, add it to the Seeds list and move on to the next Extreme.
                2. Add the Step Counter to the number of Spaces in the VWA.
                    * If the sum is less than the maximum number of Walkable Spaces in a Room, then loop to step 1 above.
                    * Otherwise, discard this Valid Walkable Area, it cannot constitute a Valid Room.
            Note that the Step Counter is cumulative across all Extrema.
    2. We now have all Seeds.
4. Find All Valid Perimeters
    1. For each set of Seeds:
        1. Pick an arbitrary Space, _s0_, from the Seed set.
            1. Find a neighbor of _s0_ that is also an Enclosing Space.
                * If no such neighbor exists, discard the VWA that generated this Seed set, it cannot be a Valid Room.
                * Otherwise, call this neighbor _s1_.
            2. Beginning at _s1_ perform a Depth-First Search.
            3. Inspect the results.
                * If the results includes all Seeds in the current set, the results are a Valid Perimeter that fully encloses the PWA.
                * Otherwise, discard this Valid Walkable Area, it cannot be a Valid Room.
    2. We now have all Valid Perimeters.
5. Construct the Potential Rooms
    1. Pair each Valid Perimeter from step 2 with the Valid Walkable Area that generated it, and add the pair to a collection of Potential Rooms.
    2. We now have all Potential Rooms.
6. Validate Rooms
    1. For each Potential Room, if:
        * its VWA does not contain at least one Entry Space _and_
        * its VP does not contain at least one Entry Space,
    then discard this Potential Room, it cannot be a Valid Room.
    2. We now have all Valid Rooms.
7. Determine Room Types
    1. For each Valid Room:
        * Compare VWA Space counts, and VWA and VP Space contents, against the counts and contents in each Room Recipe.
        * Sort matching Room Recipes by their priority.  The highest priority match is the Type of this Valid Room.

### During Play

1. Whenever a Space's ParquetStack Is Altered
    1. Check what changed in the ParquetStack.
        1. If no Floors, Blocks, or Furnishings were added or removed from the ParquetStack:
            * _Optimization_.  Ignore this alteration.
        2. Otherwise, if no Enclosing Blocks or Enclosing Furnishings were added or removed from the ParquetStack, then:
            * _Optimization_.  If the altered ParquetStack is within a known room, adjust the content of the room accordingly and repeat step "7. Determine Room Types" from the algorithm to update the room type.
            * _Optimization_.  If not, ignore this alteration.
        3. If Floors, Enclosing Blocks, or Enclosing Furnishings have changed, then:
            * _Optimization_.  If both the Player and the altered Space are within a known room:
                1. Find a square Subregion that fully encloses the current room.
                2. Remove the current room from the list of Valid Rooms.
                3. Perform the "Once a Region Finishes Loading" algorithm over the Subregion.
            * _Least Optimal Path_.  Otherwise:
                1. Remove all rooms from the list of Valid Rooms.
                2. Perform the "Once a Region Finishes Loading" algorithm over the entire Region.
